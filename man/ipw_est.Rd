\title{Calculation of weighted energy distance}
\usage{
ipw_est(y, trt, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{vector of responses}

\item{trt}{vector indicating treatment assignment of length equal to the length of \code{y}. It should
take the value 1 for treated and any other value to indicate not treated}

\item{weights}{a vector of sample weights of length equal to the length of \code{y}}
}
\value{
an estimate of a causal contrast
}
\description{
Calculates weighted energy distances between treatment groups and the full sample
}
